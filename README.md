# fitnessExercises React project

I wanted to get familiar with React's design libraries and I've chosen [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) because of it's sleek looks, popularity and broad spectrum of pre-defined components.
------
I want the app to: 
* Group exercises
* Sort by bodyparts
* Ability to click on exercise from the list => display it
* CRUD

###### also wanted to try [RDD](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/readme-driven-development)
